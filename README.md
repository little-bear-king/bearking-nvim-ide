# Nvim Config 
I am currently learning about Lua, Nvim, IDEs, and Coding. So, I forked https://github.com/LunarVim/nvim-basic-ide to be able to dig though a well put together Nvim Ide while learning to use it as well. 

# Extended Goals 
1. I would like to learn enough to successfully put together my own Nvim Config from Scratch. 
2. I would like a Nvim that is tailored for Python, Lua, Markdown, AI/Ml research. 


# Current Focus
- [ ] Quickly read through the code that is in the repo. Write down questions below
